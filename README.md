## Tech Stack

This project uses next.js.react as my front-end framework, and uses react-big-calendar and lexical to complete the overall diary function. The database uses firebase services, including Firebase Authentication, Firebase FireStore, and Firebase Storage, and is finally deployed to vercel.

## Component Tree

In this project, I chose to use next.js's page router, based on several key advantages it brings to my project:

- File-system Based Routing: Simplifies routing management through an intuitive file structure.
- Dynamic Routing: Offers flexible page routing options to meet various navigation needs.
- Static Generation and Server-side Rendering: Enhances performance and loading speed, improving user experience.
- Enhanced SEO: Increases search engine visibility through improved rendering strategies.
- Easy to Customize: Allows me to easily customize and expand functionality according to project needs.

These features have had a positive impact directly on my project, making it more efficient, reliable, and easy to manage.
