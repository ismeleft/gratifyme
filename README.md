## Tech Stack

This project uses next.js.react as my front-end framework, and uses react-big-calendar and lexical to complete the overall diary function. The database uses firebase services, including Firebase Authentication, Firebase FireStore, and Firebase Storage, and is finally deployed to vercel.

## Component Tree

I use next.js pages router because it has several benefits.

- File-system Based Routing
- Dynamic Routing
- Static Generation and Server-side Rendering
- Enhanced SEO
- Easy to Customize
